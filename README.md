# Feedback Loophole


Feedback Loophole is a simple drawing program, utilizing the Minim audio library.
It takes input from the microphone and translates it to movement of objects.

I recommend using it with an external microphone, so you can control gain manually.

## Using

— install Processing from https://processing.org/

— open .pde file

— play around


## Controlling

You control the program using the mouse. Below is a crude mouse area diagram.
	
|:----------SMALL SHAPE------------:|
|:---------------------------------------:|
|:---------------------------------------:|
|:---------------------------------------:|
|:SLOW FADE---------------------FAST FADE:|
|:---------------------------------------:|
|:---------------------------------------:|
|:-------------LARGE SHAPE---------------:|

In addition to this, clicking and holding the left or right mouse button moves the shapes in different ways.

As you can see, the controls aren't very thought out from a user's UX perspective or a performance perspective, they are currently placeholders untill I make some more performance friendly solution.
